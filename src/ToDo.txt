SteakVault:

Under each description we button underneath will say 'ENTER STEAK' - when pressed maybe a small pop saying 'coming soon' or 'under construction'


SteakPad:

The other 2 sections will have the same list but 'TBA' on all of them, for their logo just a pixalated blur maybe?

Inside each section we need a 'JOIN POOL' button and same as the 'ENTER STEAK' some sort of pop up saying 'coming soon' or something along these lines.


Contact Us:

With a send button at the bottom - this would need to forward the applicants to our email: Team@MemeSteak.io


Community:

we will also have a small part for ambassadors/marketers:
